# Predict-next-day-s-stock-price


This repository is for the development and sharing of a project focused on forecasting US stock prices for the next day, using a historical database dating back to 1950. The main objective is to employ advanced data analysis and modeling techniques to predict the future behavior of stock prices, thus providing valuable insights for investors and market analysts.

### Technologies and Tools Used

To achieve our goal, we will use the Python programming language, widely recognized for its versatility and effectiveness in the field of data analysis and machine learning. Python offers us a wide range of specialized libraries that make it easier to manipulate data, perform statistical calculations, build machine learning models, among other crucial features for this project. Some of the libraries that will be explored include:

##### NumPy: 
For mathematical operations and manipulating arrays.
##### Pandas: 
For manipulating and analyzing tabular data.
##### Matplotlib and Seaborn: 
For data visualization.
##### Scikit-learn: 
For building and evaluating machine learning models.
#####TensorFlow or PyTorch:
For building deep learning models, if necessary.
### Project structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Directory containing the dataset of US stocks since 1950.

notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model experiments.
src/: Source code with auxiliary functions, model implementations and training and evaluation scripts.

### Contributing
We are open to contributions! If you have suggestions for improvements, new features or have found a bug, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request.
